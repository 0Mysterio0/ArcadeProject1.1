# ArcadeProject1.1
Notes:
textures/directions would be super complex
using crate for boundaries


TO do list:
Import ALL THE PICTURES
Recognize particular fruit orders and advance to next level
Have an ending screen
Have score or timer
Make sound when collecting fruit
Have background music

HUGE PROJECT
recongize if fruit is wrong order
take away score or reset level or something
make a bad sound, the fruit gets sucked up and out of your basket.


So far, when a fruit hits your basket, it gets removed and the score increases.
When you hit 3 fruit that level, it starts the next level.

Initially we tried to mess with the update settings, but that was not working 
as it updated the score seveal times as the fruit was passing through the 
player sprite essentially.
