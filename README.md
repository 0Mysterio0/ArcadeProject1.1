# Arcade Project


###To Do List:
1. Import our own pictures to make game *cool*

2. ~~Make player move only between bounds~~

3. Have fruit and suckers fall from sky, with random speeds

4. Randomize fruit orders and display correct fruit

5. Advance to next level once collected fruit

6. Have an ending screen

7. Have title/intro screen

8. Have score or timer shown

9. Make sound when collecting fruit and suckers

10. Have background music

11. Made sucker movement different/harder than fruit movement, potentially
utilizing x and y coords.

12. Randomize initial placement of fruits and suckers

13. Fruit gets placed into basket

###Extra:
Ex1. after losing, the fruit gets sucked up and out of your basket.

Ex2. Player animations

Ex3. Player select
###Notes:
textures/directions would be super complex to code

Used a crate for boundaries

References were helpful, yet also not*

So far, when a fruit hits your basket, it gets removed and the score increases.
When you hit 3 fruit that level, it starts the next level.

Initially we tried to mess with the update settings, but that was not working 
as it updated the score several times as the fruit was passing through the 
player sprite essentially.
